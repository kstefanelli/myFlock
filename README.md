## Our Inspiration:
Birds of a feather flock together! We wanted to create a mobile app that  facilitates the discovery of platonic friends and activity partners based on two simple factors: shared interests and proximity.

## Try Out the App:
If you want to test our app, the prerequisite is that you have Expo installed on your device.

While our app is in development, beta testers can try it out by cloning this repo, using the terminal to navigate to the main directory, running "npm install" and then running "npm start". The start script will then open Expo where you will be prompted to view in the simulator of your choice.

An alternate to running the app in a simulator is to install Expo on a mobile device, run the start script from the terminal, and then scan the QR code. As you onboard, you will be prompted to allow the app to access your location. To get the most from myFlock, please grant this permission.


## Overview of Features:

Our onboarding sequence will get you set up in no time. Once you are signed up and logged in, you will have access to the following functions:

- The map view: a birds eye view showing you who nearby shares interests with you. For more details navigate to the list view and choose which profiles you want to examine more closely.
- The nest view shows you a collection of chats. When someone sends you a message, it will stay active for 24 hours. Then, if you don't respond in that time the message disappears. If you do choose to respond, the message history will stay in your nest view until you choose to delete it.
- Your profile view gives you easy access to edit all aspects of your profile and allows you to add or delete interests on the fly.
